## Introduction

This is the home of Club Obsidian's open source projects. Over the nearly 5 years of being in the Minecraft community Club Obsidian has developed a number of in-house projects. Over time some of the in-house developed projects will be released on our [Github](https://github.com/ClubObsidian) to give back to the communiy. If you see something on the server that you find interesting it may become open sourced in the future so stay tuned!

You can checkout some of our current open source projects below.

## Current Projects
